          <h1>Making a Website with No Experience</h1>
          <p>Entering the realm of web development, especially without any experience, was initially daunting. There are plenty of user-friendly, low-code solutions out there, but they didn't capture what I was after. For me, it was essential to immerse myself in the nitty-gritty of coding. Hence, I opted to work with HTML and CSS, hosting everything on a GitHub repository. My overarching vision? A space to chronicle my professional strides, while also making room for personal passion projects and tales that, though perhaps not always strictly professional, are dear to me.</p>

          <h2>The Tech Canvas: Tools and Choices</h2>
          <p>Here's a quick peek at my toolkit and the decisions behind them:</p>

          <h3>Hosting:</h3>
          <p>My domain was secured via Google Domains, a straightforward choice given its robust reputation. Why sift through countless options when one of the giants is right there? As for hosting, a mate vouched for GitHub. Although I lacked extensive knowledge about the alternatives, the recommendation felt genuine and well-founded.</p>

          <h3>Coding Crafting Atom:</h3>
          <p>Atom was my pick to spin the web. It's not just any old platform; it's an open-source text editor that prides itself on being hackable. Crafted by GitHub, it’s tailored for both beginners and those with a bit more code under their belts. Plus, it's a robust alternative to other big names like Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code.</p>

          <h2>ChatGPT:</h2>
          <p>ChatGPT has been instrumental in this project. Its assistance extends beyond just developing the page—it's even been a co-writer of sorts for this post. The way it lays out code, offers critiques, and suggests modifications is immensely enlightening. It does occasionally veer off course, or get stuck in a problem loop, but that’s a minor hiccup in an otherwise smooth journey. After all, with the entirety of the internet as a backup resource, these small challenges are just part of the learning experience. </p>

          <h2>Evolution in Real-time</h2>
          <p>I initially deployed a whimsical landing page idea—where a "Contact Me" button randomly jumped around the screen when clicked and displaying silly messages like "try again". This would tie the time it took me to fully develop a final product. But as my vision matured, so did my approach. Now, I've chosen to broadcast the website's evolution live. It's raw, it's candid, and it might occasionally glitch, but that’s part of the charm. Through this transparency, you're privy to the ebbs and flows of web development.</p>

          <h2>Mapping the Future</h2>
          <p>Whilst professionally oriented, I find myself more and more tempted to make this a canvas for all stories. This news section will detail professional milestones large and small, personal insights, from achievements to things I find generally interesting. The path ahead is packed with challenges and opportunities, and I am excited to take the journey. Your feedback, interest, and engagement are invaluable. Dive in, engage, and be part of this evolving story. The most exciting bits are yet to unfold!</p>
